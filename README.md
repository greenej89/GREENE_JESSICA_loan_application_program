# Lending Program
## Project Description
This is a loan application program.  The applicant may apply for loans ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 to be paid back over a 5-year period.  The interest rate for the loan depends on the applicant's credit score and 2019 income.  Applicants who have an excellent credit score (at least 720) receive a prime lending rate. Applicants who do not have an excellent credit score receive increasingly higher interest rates depending on their 2019 income. Applicants with a credit score less than 350 and income less than twice the loan amount will be denied.
## How to It Works
This program runs from terminal/command-line interface and requires text input from the user. This program requires Java to run.
The program gathers user input and determines whether the loan is approved.  If the loan is approved, the program prints the interest rate, monthly payment amount, and teh date on which the loan will be disbursed to the borrower.
## How to Use This Program
Compile and run the program.
Input text data when prompted by the terminal.

# Lending Program
## Description
This is a loan application program.  The applicant may apply for loans ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 to be paid back over a 5-year period.  The interest rate for the loan depends on the applicant's credit score and 2019 income.  Applicants who have an excellent credit score (at least 720) receive a prime lending rate. Applicants who do not have an excellent credit score receive increasingly higher interest rates depending on their 2019 income. Applicants with a credit score less than 350 and income less than twice the loan amount will be denied.
